Note: This template will not allow a scheduled refresh in the PowerBI Service (Due to a limitation in the service)
You MUST refresh this document in PBI Desktop and republish to pick up updates.

Directions:
1) Open the pbit template file in PBI Desktop.
2) When prompted, enter the workspace (note, must be full workspace name, i.e.: powerbi://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/<your workspace name> )
3) at the next prompt, enter a comma-separates list of model names to be documented.  All models MUST be in the same workspace (entered above)
4) Refresh the model (just to be sure everything is set.)
5) Save the file with whatever name you desire.
6) Publish to your desired workspace. (Could be PBI Publish, or Git Push/Deploy, either way)

Optional:
Open Power Query via the Transform data button, and change the default colors for Fact tables, Dimension tables, and defaults, if desired.
This only impacts the colors of the nodes on the Table Navigator page.
