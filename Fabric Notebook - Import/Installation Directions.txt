Installation Directions

For using a Fabric Notebook, along with a Lakehouse and Semantic Model, download the Lakehouse_Import.pbit file to your local machine
Download the nb_ModelDocumentation.jpynb notebook
If not already available, create a Fabric-enabled workspace
Upload the notebook into this workspace.
Open the notebook in the Fabric UI in the browser, and edit the variable names in the section called MANUAL CONFIG HERE in the first cell
You can specify lakehouse names, workspace names, and colors to use for the Relationship Navigator (you do not need to change these colors, unless you want to)
In addition, specify the workspaces and model names into the 'data' array.  These workspace names and model names MUST line up (i.e.: the third model name must exist in the third workspace)

Note: if you already have a lakehouse, you can enter it here. If it doesn't exist, it will be created for you.  Note that schema-enabled lakehouses MUST be created by hand prior to running the notebook

Note: the notebook and lakehouse MUST be in the same Fabric Workspace

Execute the notebook.  The necessary tables/objects will be created (if not already) and populated with the data from the specified workspace(s) and model(s)
Open the Lakehouse_Import.pbit file in PBI Desktop.
Enter the Lakehouse name into the parameters.
Publish the model, using a helpful name into your desired workspace.


Note: because this option uses a notebook and lakehouse, the notebook can be scheduled to auto refresh on any desired schedule, and the import model can also be refreshed, as normal for a PBI report
