Note, As this is a DirectLake report, there is no need for refresh of the PBI report/model.

Notebook Instructions:
1) upload the nb_ModelCatalog notebook to your desired workspace.  (Note, it can be renamed, if desired.)
   Note, the notebook must be in the same workspace as your lakehouse.
2) Fill in the required options in the first cell (workspace name, lakehouse name, etc.)
3) Enter 'DirectLake' as the option for model_type
4) Run the notebook to create and populate the lakehouse. (If the lakehouse already exists, only tables will be added.)

Repot Instructions:
1) Open the DirectLake template in PBI Desktop.
2) it will error out on 'cannot load model.'  This is expected.
3) Click on OneLake Catalog
4) Choose the DirectLake semantic model that is created by the Notebook. Named by you in the notebook parameters
6) Make sure the data connects and loads.
7) Save the report with your desired name.
8) Publish the report. (Either PBI Publish, or Git Push/Deploy)

OPTIONAL:
Because this is DirectLake, there is no need to refresh the report or semantic model.  However, you may want to schedule the notebook to run on a aschedule o pick up changes to your models.
